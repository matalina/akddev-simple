            <h1>Career</h1>
            <p>From an early age I knew I wanted to be an engineer.  I wanted to work with technology. I remember being going to a girls only conference in the 8th grade called <a href="https://techbridgegirls.org/index.php?id=466">Expanding Your Horizons</a>.  It was a place were professionals from around the country talked to girls about what is now called STEM careers. I knew pretty much then I was going to work with computers.</p>
            <p>My parents gave me a <a href="https://oldcomputermuseum.com/laser_50.html">Laser 50</a> one year for Christmas and I started learning the very basics of Basic.  I could write a hot or cold game on that tiny lcd screen and it would play it right. I still had a lot to learn.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until college that I actually started to take a big interest in programming.  I was excited going in, but unfortunately my first programming class in Pascal did not help me when I went into the next course that primarily focused on C.  I dropped the class and changed my major.  But by the end of my 3rd year, I was needing an extra course so I decided what the hell, and I took an introduction to C class.  I fell in love! What I should have learned concept wise as a freshman I finally understood.  Teachers can make or break a students love for something.  I took a second course the following semester and thus I was going into Engineering School with a love for Programming.</p>
            <p>After college I spent 4 years as an Electrical Engineer.  I loved the math, and the circuits but the stress was getting to me.  And it was just a job.  When my husband and I decided to move to Mississippi to be closer to his son, I started pushing my love for code.  I learned all about php, and WordPress in particular and started freelancing.</p>
            <p>Now I'm versed in PHP, javascript, HTML, CSS, and various databases.  I can hack my way through Python, Ruby and C# (meaning I can make something work with a lot of googling, and enough time to do it.)</p>

            <h1>Family</h1>
            <p>My early years were spent in Denver, Colorado with my relatively normal upbringing albeit a strict one.  We moved just before highschool to a small town in Upstate New York which I was not happy about.  I spent 2 years hating it and then 2 years not really caring.  College started out close to home but I still stayed in the dorms, tho I came home most weekends to do laundry.  Three years later I found myself on Long Island going to an Engineering school where I was only a handful of women on campus.</p>
            <p>I met my husband online at a Wheel of Time fan site, <a href="https://dragonmount.com">Dragonmount</a>.  He moved to New York, we got married, moved to Mississippi, and there we had two wonderful daughters who couldn't be more opposite from one another.</p>

            <h1>Hobbies</h1>
            <p>In my free time I like to write.  My pen name is <a href="https://aj-hunter.com">AJ Hunter</a> and I write urban fantasy mostly.  I do dabble a little in high fantasy and romance.  My main character, <a href="https://themindofnox.com">Nox</a>, has his own blog.</p>
            <p>Other than writing, I do a mediocore amount of reading, and playing video games.  My favorite genre to read is urban fantasy, but I like role playing games in general for video games.  My favorite game franchise is Dragon Age.</p>
